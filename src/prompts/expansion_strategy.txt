    Strategic priorities:
    - Expand into uncontrolled adjacent hexes whenever possible
    - Avoid initiating combat with enemy units
    - Protect your controlled territory through positioning, not combat
    - Focus on controlling more territory rather than eliminating enemies
    - Consider spawning units in controlled hexes to enable further expansion
