    The game state format explained:
    1. game_info: Contains current turn, max turns, and game status
    2. board.cells: Dictionary of all cells on the board where:
       - Keys are "x,y" coordinate strings
       - Each cell contains:
         - position: The x,y coordinates
         - units: Count of units for each player
    3. Unit counts show exact numbers (0 means no units present)

    Analyze the situation and provide your response in this exact JSON format:
    {            
      "moves": [
        {"source": [0, 2], "destination": [1, 2], "units": 1}
      ]
    }

    Key rules:
    - Each turn consists of three phases in this order:
      1. Movement: Units move to adjacent hexes
      2. Combat: Battles occur in hexes with opposing units
      3. Spawning: New units can be created in controlled hexes
    - Units can only move to adjacent hexes
    - Combat occurs automatically when opposing units occupy the same hex
    - You can spawn new units in hexes you fully control
    - Each hex's coordinates are represented as [x, y]
    - You must format moves exactly as specified
